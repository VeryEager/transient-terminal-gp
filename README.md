# Transient Terminal Set Genetic Programming

## Overview
The **Transient Terminal Set** is an experimental technique used to improve the interpretability of Symbolic Regression models via Multi-Objective Genetic Programming. A full overview of the algorithm and goals of the development can be found in the docs/ folder.

The code in this repository contains the implementation of TTSGP, an implementation of Standard MOGP, scripts for running and displaying the results of experiments, regression datasets for testing, documentation, and other meta-information files.
